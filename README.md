### Course Description ###
This course covers the design and development of single-page web applications and their interaction with web services. Possible topics include: HTML; JavaScript/TypeScript; RxJS; Frameworks such as Angular and/or React; Node.js; programming and security models for browsers; client-side web applications with local storage; HTTP, proxies, and caching. 

### Tools Used ###

* Visual Studio Code
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

### To Run ###

Fork it and clone it. I used WSL to run the project but if you have Node.js setup how you like it then use that. Run `npm install` then `ng serve --open`. To view the calendar page change `/homepage` to `/calendar` Click on any of the dates to visit the dayView page.

### Notes ###

This is a team project with the purpose of making a travel planner. Complete with budget planning, flight search, and a calendar with activities for the day. My part of the project was creating and modifying the calendar while communicating with the day page to send data back and forth.
